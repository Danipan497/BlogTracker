This is my first project of website created in Django. Website is in blog track formula, where any user can:
- create account,
- make personal topics and entries,
- read articles and comments,
- send mail to creator for any reason (no e-mail host included, just a simple app and Django form).

Website is designed with bootstrap4 and for now is in Debug=True mode.
